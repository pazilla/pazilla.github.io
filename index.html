<p>
My name is Mitch Franklin, and I'm the founder of Pazilla.
I achieved Life rank in the Boy Scouts of America when I was young;
I now have two young children and had been searching for a good way for all of us to do outdoor
activities together, but nothing seemed quite right for us and our friends.
With Pazilla Guides, I hope to begin a movement of helping others to get hands-on useful experience 
having fun in the outdoors and indoors too, 
by providing free resources that you can use as you please and modify if they aren't quite right,
while sharing them back with the next generation.
</p>

<p>
I welcome you to Pazilla.

We enjoy having fun outdoors with other people, and provide resources for youth scouting organizations,
or others who may not be a part of a scouting group.
All of our materials are made freely available in a free culture license
that can be optionally customized by you for your needs.

<p>We also host activities for kids and adults to have fun with friends,
and we have free guides for how to do the same thing with others in your area.
Please contact Mitch for help with your group,
or if there are guides or guidance you would like. We love outdoor activities,
but indoor activities with others are excellent too.

<p>We are a nonprofit organization in support of nonviolence.
Pazilla's mission is to advance peaceful existence by sparking dialogue, compassion, and awareness.
We bridge boundaries among diverse groups through education, services, outreach, and advocacy.
We seek to curtail violence and to mitigate conditions leading to violence, locally and globally.

<p>I encourage you to explore the guides we provide,
and fork them to make changes you may like.
You can also do a pull request if you think some changes belong in the core guides.
